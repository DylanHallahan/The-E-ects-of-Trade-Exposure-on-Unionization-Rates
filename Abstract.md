# The-Effects-of-Trade-Exposure-on-Unionization-Rates

This paper observes the direct effects of Chinese import competition
on the share of labor union participants in American manufacturing.
There is substantial evidence that increasing trade with China has led
to a faster than expected decline in traditionally labor union-heavy
industries such as manufacturing. However, there is limited evidence
that this trade shock contributes to the secular decline in the proportion 
of workers represented by unions. The data and regression on
labor union share suggest that trade exposure accounts for only 1.44
percent of the average 15 percent decline. This paper also explores
the impact of Right-to-Work laws and the policy implications of these
findings.
